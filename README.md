py-balancer
===========

A re-implement version of rbalancer in pure python without using any framework 
It works exactly the way rbalancer do: https://github.com/whatvn/rbalancer 
and work really better. 


Too busy to update this thing, will update later.

...
But I do know you totally do not need that `how-to installation`.
